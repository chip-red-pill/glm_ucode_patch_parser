# Description

The microcode patch parser for Atom Goldmont is a tool making the textual representation of the microcode patch data. The patch itself represents binary data processed by a special routine in microcode ROM. The address of the routine for Goldmont in MS ROM is U1ea6. We called the routine patch_runs_load_loop. If you study the routine you will see that the microcode patch is simply a sequence of calls to a fixed set of other routines in MS ROM, each identified by its numeric ID. This ID starts each sequence of the calls in the patch and after 4-bytes ID there placed the binary arguments for the called routine. The patch processing routines start from address U226c in MS ROM with step 4 uops (one uops tetrad), so the the routine identified by ID 0 is at U226c, by ID 1 is placed at U2270. The number of arguments varies for each routine. The calls sequence (and the ucode patch itself) ends with special call ID - 0.

We identified the base set of the patch processing routines, reverse engineered the purpose of each those routines and the number of their arguments and in our tool generate the text representation of the calls to routines: write the text description of the routine's operation and its arguments from the patch. For routines processing microoperations patching MS ROM (sent to MS Patch RAM) we perform their disassembling in-place so in the resulted text file you can see the uops in the text form. The parser tool imports our [ucode disassembler for Goldmont][4] so it must be accessible from Python import paths. Also, in the verbose mode the tool saves pcode patch data in binary form (firmware for P-unit, a power management controller for CPU) which is also contained in the microcode patch.

Our ucode patch parser script supports special verbose mode which can be specified by "-v" option. In this verbose mode the tool accumulates all the microcode related data (the values for Match/Patch registers, Sequence Words and uops) and forms three text files (ms_array2/3/4) which can be used by [ucode disassembler][4] to make the full ucode listing corresponding to the ucode patch (you can simply replace the files read from MS LDAT in runtime and use these new in disassembler).

Please note that you must run the parser for decoded patch data (by our [Micrcode Decryptor][5]) and not for original which is encrypted.
